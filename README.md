📁 File Hider Java Project

Welcome to the File Hider Java Project!
This project demonstrates how to create a secure file-hiding system using Java and MySQL, with additional features like email authentication, OTP verification, user login, and encryption.
Perfect for beginners and advanced Java programmers looking to sharpen their skills in security-focused applications.


✨ Features

🔒 User Login System (Java + MySQL)
✉ Email Authentication with OTP (One-Time Password)
🔐 File Encryption and Decryption
🗄 File Hiding Mechanism
📊 User Database Management (MySQL)
📧 Send OTP via Email (using JavaMail API)
🧩 Clean and Modular Code


🛠 Technologies Used

Java SE
MySQL Database
JavaMail API (for email functionality)
JDBC (for database connectivity)
Java Swing (for GUI, optional if added)
Encryption Techniques (e.g., AES or simple custom encryption)


📚 Learning Objectives

By building this project, you will learn
How to send emails using Java
How to implement OTP verification

Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).

Use stronger encryption algorithms like AES-256.
Add a desktop GUI with JavaFX or Swing.
Build an admin dashboard for managing users.
Encrypt the database fields as well.
