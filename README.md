## ✨ Features

- 🔒 *User Login System* (Java + MySQL)
- ✉ *Email Authentication* with OTP (One-Time Password)
- 🔐 *File Encryption and Decryption*
- 🗄 *File Hiding Mechanism*
- 📊 *User Database Management* (MySQL)
- 📧 *Send OTP via Email* (using JavaMail API)
- 🧩 *Clean and Modular Code*

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *Java SE*
- *MySQL Database*
- *JavaMail API* (for email functionality)
- *JDBC* (for database connectivity)
- *Java Swing* (for GUI, optional if added)
- *Encryption Techniques* (e.g., AES or simple custom encryption)

---

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By building this project, you will learn:
- How to send *emails* using Java
- How to implement *OTP verification*
- How to *encrypt and decrypt* files
- How to perform *CRUD operations* using JDBC with MySQL
- Best practices in *Java project structuring* and *error handling*

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Use stronger encryption algorithms like *AES-256*.
- Add a *desktop GUI* with JavaFX or Swing.
- Build an *admin dashboard* for managing users.
- Encrypt the database fields as well.
